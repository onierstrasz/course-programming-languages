a) invalid type for square is
square :: Char -> Char

The compiler doesn't know how to multiply two Chars.
You need the multiplication to calculate the square.

b) invalid type for == is
== :: (Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int) -> Bool
It is not implemented and the sense of implementing is questionable.
It would mean to compare functions. Comparing functions is problematic in general,
because this means to compare the semantics. Besides, it would be necessary to compare
all possible values of the functions -> possibly infinitely many

Note that
== :: (Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int) -> Bool
means for example
(\x -> x) == (\x -> x*x)
and not
(\x -> x) 4 == (\x -> x*x) 2

A possible way to implement it is to compare the mappings of both functions
== :: (Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int) -> Bool
(a == b) = (map a [-65535..65535] == map b [-65535..65535])
It may work in some special cases, but in general it won't since
we have to make sure that both functions terminate once. We don't
have to care about false types as return values, since we're
restricted to  Int -> Int functions.
