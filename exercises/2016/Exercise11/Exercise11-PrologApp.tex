\subsection*{Exercise 1: General questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\alph{enumi}}

\item What are definite clause grammars (DCG) and why are they particularly useful in conjunction with Prolog?
\solution{Definite clause grammars are an extension of context-free grammars. One can easily implement a concrete grammar (e.g. expressed in BNF) by means of a DCG, and the corresponding syntactic rules are directly implementable as Prolog rules. DCG rules in Prolog are just syntactic sugar for ordinary Prolog rules.}

\item How are DCG specifications translated into Prolog?
\solution{In most Prolog versions, it is a DCG interpreter which translates DCG rules into Prolog. The interpreter reads them in the form $Head\to Body$. $Head$ is always a non-terminal, and $Body$ is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals.}

\item What exactly does the 'C' predicate do? And what would be a possible explanation for its rather not meaningful name?
\solution{The 'C' predicate is used to translate (recognize) terminal symbols. It takes a symbol from the input list, and outputs also the remainder of the list for further examination. Essentially, it's a procedure for consuming tokens. It could be defined as follows:\\[2mm]
\texttt{ 'C'([Sym|Tail],Sym,Tail).}\\[2mm]
This predicate is normally not applied by the programmer, but by Prolog's DCG interpreter. This explains its obscure name.}

\item Why are left-associative grammar rules problematic?
\solution{Prolog code shouldn't have left-recursive clauses, otherwise one risks to produce infinite loops. Remember: resolution is always applied from left to right.}
	
\item How can we represent syntax trees in Prolog?
\solution{We can represent syntax trees in Prolog as functions. A node with $n$ children is a function with $n$ arguments, one argument per child. A leaf is a value.}

\item Why must DCG side conditions be put in curly brackets \{\}?
\solution{Curly brackets are solely used for side conditions in DCG. Since the side conditions are pure Prolog and thus should not be translated into Prolog, we need a way to tell the DCG interpreter that it is pure Prolog code. And since the interpreter cannot easily find out itself where a side condition starts and ends, the brackets are a useful means to make it clear.}

\subsection*{Exercise 2: Hanoi Towers}
The objective of this famous puzzle is to move $N$ disks from the left peg to the right peg using the center peg as an auxiliary holding peg. It is not allowed to place a larger disk on a smaller disk, and only one disk can be taken away at once from the top. The following diagram depicts the starting setup for $N=3$ disks:
%
\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering{\includegraphics[width=5cm, height=3cm]{hanoi.pdf}}
\end{figure}
%
\noindent Define a predicate \texttt{hanoi(N, A, B, C, Moves)} that solves the hanoi-towers problem. \texttt{Moves} holds the list of moves that represent the process of moving \texttt{N} disks from \texttt{A} to \texttt{B} with the help of \texttt{C}. If \texttt{N} is bigger than 1, then \texttt{N-1} disks will be shifted to \texttt{C}, so that the move from \texttt{A} to \texttt{B} can be accomplished. The move of a disk from \texttt{A} to \texttt{B} will be represented as \texttt{[a to b]}. The binary operator \emph{to} is loaded into the knowledge base by the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
  :- ensure_loaded(library(operators)). % load readable operators
  :- op(900, xfy, to).                  % define new infix operator 'to'
\end{verbatim}
\noindent Examples:
\begin{verbatim}
  ?- hanoi(1,a,b,c,X).		
  X = [a to b] ?			
  yes					

  ?- hanoi(2,a,b,c,X).
  X = [a to c, a to b, c to b] ?
  yes
\end{verbatim}
