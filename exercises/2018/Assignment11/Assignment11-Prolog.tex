Create a finite collection of definite clause grammar rules to check whether a sentence is grammatically correct.
%
A sentence can be composed of the following words:
\begin{description}
	\item [\texttt{article}] \texttt{a}, \texttt{the}
	\item [\texttt{noun}] \texttt{girl}, \texttt{boy}
	\item [\texttt{pronoun}] \texttt{that}, \texttt{this}
	\item [\texttt{auxiliary}] \texttt{is}
	\item [\texttt{verb}] \texttt{sleeps}, \texttt{likes}.
\end{description}
%
A sentence must be in one of the following forms \texttt{subject-predicate} and  \texttt{subject-predicate-object}.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{subject} is formed out of either an \texttt{article} and a \texttt{noun}, or a \texttt{pronoun}. For example, \texttt{a girl} or \texttt{that}.
\item \texttt{predicate} is either an \texttt{auxiliary} or a \texttt{verb}
\item \texttt{object} is formed out of an \texttt{article} and a \texttt{noun}
\end{itemize}
%
In the \texttt{subject-predicate} form of a sentence, the \texttt{predicate} can be only \texttt{sleeps}.
%
In the \texttt{subject-predicate-object} form of a sentence the verb can be either \texttt{likes} or \texttt{is}. If the \texttt{predicate} is \texttt{likes}, the 		\texttt{subject} is composed of an \texttt{article} and a \texttt{noun}. If the \texttt{predicate} is \texttt{is}, the \texttt{subject} is a \texttt{pronoun}.\\ \\
%
\textbf{Write a Prolog question to produce all correct sentences in the grammar.}\\ \\
%
You can test your program with the following examples: \\
\texttt{this is a sleeps // False} \\
\texttt{this is a likes // False} \\
\texttt{the boy likes // False} \\
\texttt{that boy likes // False} \\
\texttt{a boy the the girl // False} \\
\texttt{this is a boy // True} \\
\texttt{that is the girl // True} \\
\texttt{the girl likes a girl // True}
