\subsection*{Exercise 1 (2 points)}

You should implement the \texttt{Person} prototype which has the following characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item The \texttt{name} property which is accessible by other objects of this prototype.
   \item The \texttt{password} property which cannot be accessed by other objects of this prototype.
   \item The \texttt{counter} property whose value is shared among all objects of this prototype.
 \end{enumerate}

You need to create two objects of this prototype in order to do the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Show how to access the \texttt{name} property in both objects.
   \item What output do you get if you try to access the \texttt{password} property? How can you correct it?
   \item How to access the \texttt{counter} property? If you change the value of the \texttt{counter} property in one object, does it affect the property value on the second object?
 \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Exercise 2 (2 points)}


A possible classification for animals is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ex2}. When it comes to classify the platypus you realize that it nurses but it also spawns. So implement the class diagram shown in figure \ref{fig:ex2} including the poor platypus in Java Script. Use the \href{http://scg.unibe.ch/download/lectures/pl2018-exercises/poorPlatypusToSolve.html}{poorPlatypusToSolve.html} file as skeleton for your implementation.

\subsection*{Exercise 3 (2 points)}



In this exercise, the prototype \texttt{People} is defined. You need to define two objects of this prototype.
The first object must be created by the \texttt{Object.create()} method and the second object must be created by a constructor function.
Finally, to check if your solution is correct, run the \texttt{checkit} method from the \href{http://scg.unibe.ch/download/lectures/pl2018-exercises/Third-template.htm}{template}.
This method must return \texttt{Bern} in both objects.
