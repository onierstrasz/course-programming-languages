Substitution (subtype) €”a specification notion. B is a subtype of A if an object of B can masquerade as an object of A in any context.

Inheritance (subclass)€” should not be confused with subtyping. In general, subtyping establishes an is-a
relationship, whereas subclassing only reuses implementation and establishes a syntactic relationship,
not necessarily a semantic relationship (inheritance does not ensure behavioral subtyping). 

To distinguish these concepts, subtyping is also known as interface inheritance, whereas subclassing is
known as implementation inheritance or code inheritance. Subclassing example is in question number 4.
