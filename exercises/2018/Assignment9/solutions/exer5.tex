Block 1: covariance \\
Block 2: contravariance \\
Block 3: contravariance \\
The $<$? extends Number$>$  says the compiler uses some unknown (the ?) subtype of Number. \\
It explicitly constrains the wildcard (the ?) to represent the unknown subtype of Number. \\
In other words, the method is a covariant use of the List of Numbers; it works with any List of any subtype of Number.\\
€œThe $<$? super Number$>$ represents some unknown supertype of Number. \\
It is a contravariant use of the List of Numbers and it works for any List of any supertype of Number. \\
Truck is not a subtype of Car. Car is not a subtype of Truck.\\
The 4.2 number  would not be allowed because the compiler cannot determine what the actual type of the object is 
in the generic structure. \\
