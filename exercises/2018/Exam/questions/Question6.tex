\noindent
Suppose you have a small JavaScript program with a database of animals:

\begin{verbatim}
var animal = {
   eat: function () {
       return "munch";
   }
};

var tom = Object.create(animal);
tom.name = "Tom";
tom.size = 70;

var jerry = Object.create(animal);
jerry.name = "Jerry";
jerry.size = 5;

var spike = Object.create(animal);
spike.name = "Spike";
spike.size = 100;
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (2 points) What is the prototype of Tom, Jerry and Spike?
\vspace{4cm}

\item (3 points) Extend the code so that \texttt{tom}, \texttt{jerry} and \texttt{spike} respond to the message \texttt{sleep}. For example, \texttt{jerry.sleep()} outputs \texttt{"Jerry sleeps"}.
\vspace{5cm}

\item (3 points) \texttt{jerry} is sick and no longer eats, instead he responds with \texttt{"I am sick"}, while the others still respond with \texttt{"munch"}. Update the code correspondingly.
\end{enumerate}
