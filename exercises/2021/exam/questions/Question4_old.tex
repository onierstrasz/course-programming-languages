Consider the following $\lambda$-expressions. Indicate which occurrences of
variables are bound and which ones are free in the expressions.

\begin{itemize}
\item (1 point) \\ \texttt{($\lambda$ x .~x ~y) ($\lambda$ x ~y ~z.~x) x ~z}
\vspace{7cm}
\item (2 points) \\ \texttt{(($\lambda$ x .~$\lambda$ y z .~z~y ) ($\lambda$ x y z. y x) y) z ($\lambda$ x~z.~z x) ($\lambda$ x .~z x)}
\end{itemize}
