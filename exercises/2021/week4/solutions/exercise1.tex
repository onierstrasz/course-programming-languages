\texttt{factors :: Int -> [Int]}\\
since both \texttt{n} and \texttt{x} are arguments of the function \texttt{mod} which accepts only the \texttt{Int} arguments\\
\\
\texttt{isPerfect :: Int -> Bool}\\
since \texttt{n} is an argument of the function \texttt{factors} which accepts only the \texttt{Int} arguments,\\
and \texttt{== :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool}\\
\\
Both functions are monomorphic.\\

\texttt{insert :: Int -> a -> [a] -> [a]}\\
since\\
\texttt{insert \_ n l = [n] => insert :: a->b->c->[b]}\\
\texttt{insert 0 n l = n:l => insert :: Int->b->[b]->[b]}\\
The \texttt{insert} function is polymorphic.

\texttt{mH (a, b, c) = c} \\

\texttt{mH :: (x, y, z) -> z}\\
mH is polymorphic since the three elements a, b, and c may be of any type. \\
