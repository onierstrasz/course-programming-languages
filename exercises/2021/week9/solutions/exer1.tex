Subtyping:
B is a subtype of A if anywhere one can use an A, a B could also be used.
Subtyping has substitution. B is a subtype of A if an object of B can masquerade as an object of A in any context.
For instance, Square is not a true subtype of Rectangle because: (1) Rectangles are expected to have a width and height
that can be mutated independently, (2) Squares violate that expectation

Subclassing:
Subclassing should not be confused with subtyping. as a whole, subtyping acknowledges an is-a relationship.
In contrast, subclassing reuses exiting implementation, factors out repeated code, and establishes a syntactic relationship.
In addition, inheritance does not ensure behavioral subtyping.
Subclassing provides
